# safe_home

A new Flutter project.

Homelessness has been a problem throughout the world for centuries. The problem continues to grow every year, but there is still no solution. While a majority of homeless groups exist solely in modernised cultures, homelessness remains a problem throughout the world. Everywhere there are people in constant search of food, water and shelter. Many of these people have nowhere to go and can find no end or relief to their suffering. 
Homelessness was originally believed to be a cultural problem but is now revealing itself as a global problem. It is a problem suffered by all of humanity
and must be faced and solved as such. Although this problem exists everywhere, it is more severe in certain parts of the world. Due to the differing circumstances of homelessness around the world, there can be no one solution or one set of guidelines for everyone to follow. 
It would be beneficial if there exist a mobile app for rescuing these people. When someone who is in need of shelter is found, the one can report about that person the mobile app so that a Rescue team will be sent to the location and the person who requires shelter can be provided with necessary requirements. The safe home app is
excellent for finding persons who are displaced in their communities and spread within a geographical area or location. 
With this app, you can reach out to the homeless in the quickest ways and help to
provide them with solutions to their challenges and problems.
